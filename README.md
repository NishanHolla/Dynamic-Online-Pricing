### **1. Dynamic Pricing Model for E-commerce**

**Concepts Used:**

- **Statistical Modeling:** Hypothesis Testing, A/B Testing, Sample Size Estimation
- **ML Algorithms:** Regression (for demand forecasting), Classification (predicting user behavior), Clustering (customer segmentation)
- **Deep Learning:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for time series forecasting
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Pricing strategy optimization

**Project Overview:**

Build a dynamic pricing model that adjusts product prices based on market demand, competitor pricing, and user behavior.

- **Data:** Use Kaggle datasets (or scrape e-commerce sites)
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Outcome:** Predict best price points to maximize revenue and analyze customer purchase behavior
